# YouTube Sync

YouTube Sync is a simple chrome extension that enables fully syncrhonized videos across many devices.

## Installation

The extension can be installed through the Chrome Web Store: https://bit.ly/youtubesync

## Usage

#### Party Creation
One person creates a party and shares the generated party code. Anyone with the code can then join the party. 

#### Synchronizing
When a party member wants to sync their video, they can press sync and their video player will be synchronized with that of the host's. 

#### Additional Notes
The sync will not work if the host is not on an active tab that is playing a video. If the urls of the party member and host are different, the sync will replace the current tab with the video playing on the host's end.
